IDEA 1:
Look at quotes which are given more media coverage (must choose in terms of numOccurrences or just quote counts). Try determining what makes a quote be popular:
- Speaker: occupation, genre, age, ???            ---------> May want to compare these stats to those of the whole population in the country of origin
- Text: word count to see if some words are more common in viral quotes (may want to try with PCA or encodings to classify if quotes are provocative or not, and a general topic)
- Date: some times of year papers are more prone to publishing? Maybe relate to some real-world events (try extracting variance of date per quote too)
- Newspaper: do these stats change for different newspapers?



IDEA 2:
Try to look at correlations between the stock market and quotes (in terms of date, argument discussed, ...)
